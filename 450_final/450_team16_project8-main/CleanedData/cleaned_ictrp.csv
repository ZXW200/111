Part A: Multiple Ascending Dose Cohorts (Cohorts 1-4) Part A will consist of up to four cohorts of nine subjects. Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive an oral dose of active IMP (six subjects) or matching placebo (three subjects) for 10 days in a sequential escalating manner with a minimum of 7 days interval between two cohorts. In Part A, each cohort will follow a sentinel dose-escalation schedule; two subjects will be dosed on the first dosing day of each cohort (1 subject on active IMP and 1 subject on matching placebo). The remainder of the cohort (five subjects on active IMP and two subjects on matching placebo) will be dosed a minimum of 48 hours later pending confirmation of an acceptable safety profile in the dose-leader cohort by the Principal Investigator (PI), or medically-qualified designees who are familiar with the study protocol and Investigator’s Brochure (IB). The planned starting dose for Cohort 1 is 400 mg of DNDI-0690 once a day for 10 days. Doses to be administered in Cohorts 2 to 4 will be determined based on emerging PK and safety data. The number of daily doses may be increased to 2 by the implementation of a twice a day (BID) dosing regimen if the number of capsules in a single intake is raising concerns of acceptability.

Related: There is at least a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between an adverse event and an investigational medicinal product. This means that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship. 4. Severity of AEs assessed based on the clinical judgement of the investigator, occurring from first dosing up to post-study follow-up visit (14 to 18 days post last dose).

Mild: An AE that is easily tolerated by the subject, causes minimal discomfort, and does not interfere with everyday activities 4.2. Moderate: An AE that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities; intervention may be needed 4.3. Severe: An AE that prevents normal everyday activities; treatment or other intervention usually needed 4.4.

The study aim is to assess a combination of drugs for Chagas disease (CD) therapy, assuming benznidazol (BZ) as the drug of choice plus dissulfiram (DF) as repositioned drug. It is hypothesized that employing the drug of choice with a repositioned one, contributes to the establishment of a new effective, well-tolerated low-cost combination therapy for chronic CD patients. From eligibility confirmation, nine (n = 9) participants will be allocated to the first medication treatment level. The treatment will begin with the lowest dose of BZ for 60 days, corresponding to 100 mg/day associated with 250 mg/day of DF. Upon safety confirmation of the lowest dose of BZ, a new group of 9 patients (group II) will receive a higher dose of BZ (200 mg/day BZ + 250 mg/day DF). After confirming the safety of this dose, another group of 9 patients (group III) will receive the maximum recommended dose of BZ, which is 300 mg/day+250 mg/day DF. Directly after the completion of group III, we will start group IV with 9 others patients receiving the lowest dose of BZ, however associated with 500mg/day of DF. The scheduling scheme will be similar to that previously described for BZ dose progression. Thus, we will have group V (200mg/day of BZ + 500mg/day of DF) and group VI (300mg/day of BZ + 500mg/day of DF).

As patients were included in this study, they made over a period of one week a laboratory evaluation including complete blood count, glucose, urea and creatinine, uric acid, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides, sodium, calcium and potassium, total proteins and fractions, liver function tests and thyroid, examination of stools and urine analysis for abnormal elements and sediment. These tests were performed throughout this study when clinically required.
