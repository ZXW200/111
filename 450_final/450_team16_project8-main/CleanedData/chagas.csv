RBR-5n4htp,DISULFIRAM REPURPOSING IN THE COMBINED CHEMOTHERAPY OF CHAGAS DISEASE – PHASE I/II CLINICAL TRIAL,Chagas Disease,Chagas disease;C01.610,BRA,Brazil,Single Country,"This is a randomized, non-blinded clinical study with six arms. The study aim is to assess a combination of drugs for Chagas disease (CD) therapy, assuming benznidazol (BZ) as the drug of choice plus dissulfiram (DF) as repositioned drug. It is hypothesized that employing the drug of choice with a repositioned one, contributes to the establishment of a new effective, well-tolerated low-cost combination therapy for chronic CD patients. From eligibility confirmation, nine (n = 9) participants will be allocated to the first medication treatment level. The treatment will begin with the lowest dose of BZ for 60 days, corresponding to 100 mg/day associated with 250 mg/day of DF. Upon safety confirmation of the lowest dose of BZ, a new group of 9 patients (group II) will receive a higher dose of BZ (200 mg/day BZ + 250 mg/day DF). After confirming the safety of this dose, another group of 9 patients (group III) will receive the maximum recommended dose of BZ, which is 300 mg/day+250 mg/day DF. Directly after the completion of group III, we will start group IV with 9 others patients receiving the lowest dose of BZ, however associated with 500mg/day of DF. The scheduling scheme will be similar to that previously described for BZ dose progression. Thus, we will have group V (200mg/day of BZ + 500mg/day of DF) and group VI (300mg/day of BZ + 500mg/day of DF).
