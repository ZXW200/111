We examined the impact of a combination of human mass chemotherapy, snail control through mollusciciding and SjCTPI bovine vaccination on the human incidence of infection. Following the baseline survey, the interventions were implemented in 18 intervention groups from 2013 to 2017. The investigators, including the research team, and study participants were blind to the vaccine allocation. At baseline all residents (60 mg/kg directly observed split oral dose) and bovines (30 mg/kg directly feed oral dose) were treated with a directly observed oral dose of PZQ. Villages were then pair-matched for the RCT based on historical prevalence, baseline outcomes, and transmission ecology. One of three intervention ARMs (no specific intervention (control), human mass praziquantel (PZQ) treatment, mollusciciding) were randomly assigned to each pair to achieve three pairs per intervention type. Within each pair, one village was randomly assigned the active vaccine for vaccinating bovines and the other village received a placebo vaccine. The intervention matrix is shown below:Intervention---------Vaccinated Bovines-------Unvaccinated bovinesMollusciciding----------3 Villages (A)----------------3 Villages (B)Human treatment-----3 Villages (C)----------------3 Villages (C)Neither------------------3 Villages (D)----------------3 Villages (e) ControlsBovines received the priming SjCTPI DNA vaccine and then the protein boost or placebo control in VacSIM® six months later, in 2013 with subsequent booster vaccinations or placebo controls in VacSIM® given in 2014, 2015 and 2016.
